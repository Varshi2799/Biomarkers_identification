## 1. Pre-Molecular Era (Before 1970s)
### Approach:
- Observational correlations between symptoms and physiological markers.
- Routine biochemical assays (blood, urine tests).

### Examples:
- Glucose for diabetes.
- ALT/AST for liver damage.
- PSA for prostate function.

---

## 2. Molecular Biology Era (1970s–1980s)
### Approach:
- DNA, RNA, and protein profiling via blotting techniques.
- Use of monoclonal antibodies.

### Tools:
- Southern, Northern, and Western blotting.

### Examples:
- HER2/neu in breast cancer.
- Tumor suppressors (e.g., p53).

---

## 3. Genomics and High-Throughput Screening Era (1990s–early 2000s)
### Approach:
- Gene expression via microarrays.
- Proteomics via mass spectrometry.

### Tools:
- Affymetrix microarrays, MALDI-TOF.

### Examples:
- Breast cancer molecular subtyping.
- Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular biomarker panels.

---

## 4. Bioinformatics and In Silico Era (Mid-2000s–2010s)
### Approach:
- Mining large public datasets (e.g., GEO, TCGA).
- Statistical models and machine learning.

### Tools:
- R/Bioconductor, Cytoscape, DAVID, STRING.

### Examples:
- Gene signatures for cancer prognosis.
- BCR-ABL in leukemia.

---

## 5. Systems Biology and Multi-Omics Integration (2010s–2020s)
### Approach:
- Network and pathway modeling.
- Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, etc.

### Tools:
- iCluster, KEGG, Reactome, OmicsNet.

### Examples:
- PD-L1 and TMB as immunotherapy biomarkers.
- Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

---

## 6. AI and Precision Medicine Era (2020s–present)
### Approach:
- Deep learning for multi-modal data analysis.
- Use of real-world evidence and EHR integration.

### Tools:
- AlphaFold, DeepVariant, AutoML.

### Examples:
- Predictive biomarkers for CAR-T therapy.
- AI-derived fusion gene detection.

## BCR-ABL as a Case Study

### Timeline:
- **1960**: Philadelphia chromosome identified.
- **1985**: BCR-ABL fusion gene discovered as the oncogenic driver of CML.
- **2001**: FDA approval of Imatinib (Gleevec) as the first targeted therapy.
- **2000s–2020s**: In silico tools used to:
- Predict resistance mutations.
- Model protein structure and drug interactions.
- Analyze single-cell expression and residual disease.

### Significance:
- First molecular biomarker to lead to a successful targeted therapy.
- Catalyst for bioinformatics and computational modeling in oncology.
